# Design Patterns in Java – Creational, Behavioural, & Structural
We will be discussing about design patterns in Java
# What is design patterns?
    Java Design Patterns are techniques that provide a traditional business approach to resolve a recurring problem. Using design patterns saves time. There are several Java design patterns that can be use in Java projects.
    Using design patterns in Java promotes reusability that ends up in a lot of robust and highly maintainable code. It helps in reducing Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) of the software package.
    Since design patterns are already defined, it makes our code straightforward to understand and debug. It ends up in quicker development and new members of the team are aware of it simply.
# What are the categories or types of design patterns?
  Design patterns are in 3 categories
  1. Creational
  2. Structural, and
  3. Behavioural design patterns
# Let us have a look at each individually
  ## A. Creational Design Patterns in Java
  Creational design patterns in Java give an answer to instantiate an object within the very best approach for specific things.
  i. Singleton Pattern

  Singleton design patterns in Java restricts the instantiation of a class and ensures that just one instance of the class exists within the Java virtual machine. It looks to be a really easy design pattern, however, once it involves implementation, it comes with a lot of implementation concerns. The implementation of the Singleton pattern has always been a disputable topic among developers.
  ii. Factory Pattern

Factory design patterns in Java is used once we have an excellent class with multiple sub-classes and a super input. In this, we need to define the interface or abstract class for creating an object. Subclasses are responsible for the creation of an instance of the class. The Factory Pattern is also called as Virtual Constructor.

iii. Abstract Factory Pattern

Abstract factory Java pattern can compare to factory pattern and its factory of factories. A single factory category that returns the various sub-classes supported the input provided and factory class uses if-else or switch statement to attain this.

In Abstract factory pattern, we tend to eliminate if-else block and have a factory class for every sub-class and so an Abstract factory class which will return the sub-class supported the input factory category.

iv. Builder Pattern

Builder patterns in Java solves the problem with the sizable amount of ex gratia parameters and inconsistent state by providing how to create the item in small stages and supply a method which will really return the final Object. Examine the Builder Pattern as an example program and a new employed in JDK.

v. Prototype Pattern

Prototype design patterns in Java employes once the object creation could be an expensive affair and needs a lot of your time and resources and you’ve got the same object already existing. Therefore this pattern provides a mechanism to copy the initial object to a replacement object and so modify it per our wants. This pattern uses Java cloning to copy the object.

Prototype design pattern mandates that the object that you’re copying should provide the super feature. It mustn’t be done by the other class. But whether or not to use a shallow or deep copy of the item properties depends on the necessities and it’s a design call. Examine paradigm Pattern for a sample program.
